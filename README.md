# poc-hashlink-blockcerts
evaluate using hashlinks into blockcerts

TODO:
- issue a blockcerts referencing hashlinks
- parse `display` property to find hashlinks
- update images 

NOTE:
The code from Digital Bazaar is not entirely maintained so we would need our own implementation which can be derived from the source repo:
